This assignment involves computing the disparity on two datasets.
a) A pair of images (in the directory pair 1), 
b) A pair of images (im1, im2) generated from a code in 'stereo pair 2.m'

Your task is to compute and show the disparity as an image (depth map).
The disparity computation is to be carried out by searching for the best patch matches between the two images using 
i) Sum of absolute difference
ii)Sum of squared difference
iii) Normalized cross-correlation

 
Useful notes for the implementation: 

In both cases, arbitarily choose one of the images as a reference view.
The disparity can be computed by searching for the best patch matches between the reference and non-reference images, only in the horizontal direction (or in the same row).

The search space for the disparity in both cases is as follows
a) 0 to 20
b) 0 to 15

To visualze the disparity as an image, scale the computed disparity as follows:
a) scale by 16
b) scale by 20
